         <h2> <strong>About Me </strong> </h2>

            <p1> I define myself as a person with great organizational skills, very peculiar creativity 
                <em>(not to say uncommon)</em>, and determined, I like to focus on what is important, and what is essential,
                 and I try to stay away from everything that is not useful to me, which is reflected 
                 in all my actions. </p1>

            <p2>My rational thought is evident in my preference for geometry, for the simple, discarding the complex. 
                And here is one of my favorite phrases said by a German architect, long before hearing it Iwas already
                 immersed in this style.   <blockquote>"less is more"<cite>Mies van der Rohe<sup>[1]</sup></cite></blockquote></p2>
