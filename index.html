            <p> I define myself as a person with great organizational skills, very peculiar creativity 
                <em>(not to say uncommon)</em>, and determined, I like to focus on what is important, and what is essential,
                 and I try to stay away from everything that is not useful to me, which is reflected 
                 in all my actions. 
            </p>

            <p>My rational thought is evident in my preference for geometry, for the simple, discarding the complex. 
                And here is one of my favorite phrases said by a German architect, long before hearing it I was already
                 immersed in this style <blockquote><cite>"Less is more."Mies van der Rohe<sup>[1]</sup></cite></blockquote>
